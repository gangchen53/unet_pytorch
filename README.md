This codebase has basic functionality for image segmentation tasks. I tested this code with the dataset of the skin lesion image segmentation task of the ISIC 2016 challenge, and you can download the dataset from the link【[https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/)】. 
The link to the paper is [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf).
The experimental results are in the folder results/U-Net. The trained model can be downloaded from the link 【[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tfaqbr9CRRFuBhm7fPsAC29ZY_IY1jM4/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tfaqbr9CRRFuBhm7fPsAC29ZY_IY1jM4/view?usp=sharing)】.

### Thank you very much for pointing out if there is something wrong with the code !
