This codebase has basic functionality for image segmentation tasks. I tested this code with the dataset of the skin lesion image segmentation task of the ISIC 2016 challenge, and you can download the dataset from the link【[https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/)】. 
The link to the paper is [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf). 
The experimental results are in the folder results/U-Net. The trained model can be downloaded from the link 【[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tfaqbr9CRRFuBhm7fPsAC29ZY_IY1jM4/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tfaqbr9CRRFuBhm7fPsAC29ZY_IY1jM4/view?usp=sharing)】. 

The experimental results on the test set (with 379 images) are shown in the following table:

|     Loss Type      | Test Loss | IoU  | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
| :----------------: | :-------: | :--: | :------: | :-------: | :----: |
| Cross Entropy Loss |   0.30    | 0.73 |   0.88   |   0.89    |  0.89  |

Some test set prediction results are shown below:
